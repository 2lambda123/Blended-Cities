continuation of a procedural city project begun with 2.4x :

* a better class_import by der_On push on master branch
. class_import debug by littleneo. bugs were in main.py and register_builder().
inheritance thing was not the reason in fact, it's almost der_On code
. added sys module cleaning (restart unnecessary while modding addon)
. added a quick patch for sidewalk stacking and building inheritance

2011/07/30
. elm.remove(True) remove an element from collections, rebuild relationship. boolean True to remove the object too
. elm.stack('buildername') build a new 'buildername' above this. with no args, add the same builder than the parent
. elm.child() added child index argument elm.child(2) returns the third child
. city.elementGet() with no args returns now bld and otl of the active object
. consolidated city methods (list, add, stack, remove)
. add, stack and remove work now with several selected objects in a row
. added elm.Previous() elm.Parent()
. updated addon

2011/07/29
. element method elm.objectAttach() elm.objectDetach()
. city method city.list() city.build(), cleaning code, operator names
. added an example file about objects and elements
. added info ('how to use it') in DOCUMENTATION
* Merge branch 'local-coords' by der_On : local point of view, looks better since childs parts updates accordingly to parent transformations

2011/07/28
. appended scale mecanism : class_main.py dataGet/Set
and meshes_io buToMeters() and meters ToBu()
(see CITY MAIN SCALE in DOCUMENTATION)
. cleaned the buildings class (buildbox() now in build() )
. retested element remove / add, misc debug

2011/07/27
. outline and builder are now parented. outline and outline childs too.
. code cleaning. code splitting. needs litterature, more documentation
. improved function documentation.
. elements own outlines-only methods, this to have a cleaner code , like elm.childAdd() rather than elm.asOutline().childAdd() 
. appended 'bin' to 'core' mod by ondrej 
. first remove element feature, to check. cares about parenting in 'real world' too.
.. lot of stuff, but it's initial/test/concept time, still going with my machete in the jungle.

. can be enabled by default. can be disabled without complaining. can reload the builders classes and submodules without restarting blender, if addons dependencies v0.3 is installed http://jerome.le.chat.free.fr/index.php/en/download/blender/addon-dependencies-download.html
with the normal addon utils tool, this can't be reenabled without restarting Blender utils since this one does not clean sys.modules : the BC_builders class is created at init time (exec code. stores the builders pointers that are gathered from the builders folder) and blender find it in its sys.module whereas it has not been created yet : it fails.
without the mod, RIGHT after having disabled the addon, one can copy this in a text block :

import sys
module_name = 'blended_cities'
for m in dict(sys.modules) :
    if module_name + '.' == m[0:len(module_name) +1 ] :
        print('\taddon_utils.removing %s child : %s'%(module_name,m[len(module_name) +1:]))
        del sys.modules[m]
try : del sys.modules[module_name]
except : pass

.. then run it. this should refresh the builders files and the other at the same occasion without restarting.

. uploaded the documentation here
http://jerome.le.chat.free.fr/projets/blendedCities25/documentation/internal/html/index.html
can be retrieved from github too but destined to collaborative updates.

2011/07/25
. internal documentation ( doxygen ) created /documentation/internal/html. begin to document internal code, cleaning, naming convention.
. debug. renamed some function : inElement -> asElement, inClass -> asBuilder, inOutlines -S asOutline
( naming convention isLikeThat to recognize BC functions from_the_bpy_ones )
. added a fake builder class, sidewalk (test purposes)
. added command examples in /documentation/internal/examples
. new builders modules moved in the builders should now append automatically at init. their name should appear in the Outlines panel, and their gui should be spawned if needed. building_class.py and its ui are references (I mean will be)
. parts moved from modules to another, still organizing things.
. some ui improvements

2011/07/24
. turned it as a module. first multifile split and organisation.

2011 june-july
. first test using blender 2.5, bpy classes first generated thing with it :)
