. internal documentation ( doxygen ) created /documentation/internal/html. begin to document internal code, cleaning, naming convention.
. debug. renamed some function : inElement -> asElement, inClass -> asBuilder, inOutlines -S asOutline
( naming convention isLikeThat to recognize BC functions from_the_bpy_ones )
. added a fake builder class, sidewalk (test purposes)
. added command examples in /documentation/internal/examples
. new builders modules moved in the builders should now append automatically at init. their name should appear in the Outlines panel, and their gui should be spawned if needed. building_class.py and its ui are references (I mean will be)
. parts moved from modules to another, still organizing things.
. some ui improvements
