#examples :
# lines below can be parsed directly in the console
# after you created a building from an outline
# use it for debug also :)

# BEFORE TO TEST THIS, CREATE TWO PLANE
# ON THE SECOND PLANE (plane.001), CREATE A BUILDING

city = bpy.context.scene.city

# from an object, retrieve the corresponding element
obj = bpy.context.active_object
elm, otl= city.elementGet(obj)

objname = 'buildings.00000'
bld, otl = city.elementGet(objname)

# returns the internal name of the element :
bld.name

# return the name of the object attached to the element :
bld.objectName()
otl.objectName()

# the outline object name as not been changed

# change the name of the attached object :
otl.objectNameSet('spam')
bld.objectNameSet('egg')

# retrieve the object of an element :
ob = bld.object()
ob.name = 'flying circus'

# relation ship between elements and object remains
bld.floorNumber = 20

# initialise the name of the attached object to the element name :
otl.objectNameSet()
bld.objectNameSet()

bld.floorNumber = 10

# attach an outline element to another object
otl.objectAttach('Plane')
